#### Here, I would be exploring the world of Bioinformatics! 👩‍💻

### Motivation:
You can say, my love for medical data analysis urged me to also look beyond the images and video data formats. 
I would be using R through out this journey. While speaking as of today, my R programming skills are pretty basic. So, hopefully at the end we'll have formed new neural connections.
And yes, you're right! I mean to say:

1. Knowledge in the area of Molecular Biology
2. Better R skills
3. Real world applications of the Statistics concepts

I'll be adding more as I discover :) ...
